# linear_prediction
Simple Python code and shell driver for the prediction of critical quenching perturbations.

Includes example data (from the FitzHugh-Nagumo model with gamma = 1e-3) and a run bash script.

Figures for input, testing, and progress are outputted during execution; opening the file $savedir/linear_theory.svg during execution will update live (subject to your machine and set up).

A brief repository considering the neural network interpolant suggested is found [here](https://github.com/cmarcotte/nn_interpolant).
